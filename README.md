# AI/ML Case Studies - PG Program at Texam University

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of case studies completed as part of the Postgraduate (PG) program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at Texam University. Each case study focuses on a specific aspect of AI/ML, ranging from traditional machine learning techniques to cutting-edge solutions like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and model deployment on platforms like Hugging Face.

## Case Studies
1. **Traditional Machine Learning**: Building predictive models using techniques like decision trees, random forests, and logistic regression.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
3. **Machine Learning**: Developing predictive models for specific business problems, such as personal loan approval prediction.
4. **Computer Vision**: Implementing deep learning models for image classification and object detection.
5. **Neural Networks**: Using advanced architectures like LSTMs for time-series forecasting and energy prediction.
6. **Model Deployment**: Developing and deploying machine learning models using APIs, Docker, and cloud platforms.
7. **NLP with Generative AI**: Implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solutions for tasks like medical diagnosis assistance.

## Purpose
These case studies are designed to provide hands-on experience with real-world AI/ML problems, covering the entire lifecycle of machine learning projects:
